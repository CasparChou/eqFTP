## Your favorite FTP tool is back

**This time everything's changed.**
From the toolbar icon to code structure.

We changed UI. Entirely. This time we used Material Design Guidelines from Google to make a really good looking and user friendly application. It has intuitive design and we will add Tips and Guides soon so it will be even more friendly and self-explaining.

We changed the code. Also entirely. Now it's a lot more structured and well-designed code. It's more secure, more stable and not that ugly as before! It's still not an ES6, but hey, it's working pretty good and it's a lot better than it was before.

**What BETA-testers think about it already:**

> Man, it's so good...

> It's the best ftp tool I've ever seen!
